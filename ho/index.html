        This bar chart race is designed to showcase the total revenue for each platform on a yearly basis. Therefore, it
        displays information for one year at a time, and the monetary unit is US dollars (US$).

        <h2>My Observation</h2>
        In this bar chart race, it is possible to observe that initially, there
        may be only one game company(2600) dominating the entire gaming industry,
        with competitors gradually emerging later on. However, as the bar chart
        race progresses into the middle to later stages, several platforms suddenly
        emerge, and their revenue surpasses that of all their competitors, establishing
        a significant lead.

    <div class="Improvements">
        <h2>Some Improvements</h2>
        Since the main modification is based on the official D3 example, the flexibility
        is limited. It means that it's not possible to make specific modifications to
        individual functionalities. If needed, the only option is to rewrite all the
        functionalities. Therefore, this can serve as a starting point for exploring
        more D3 functionalities through the bar chart race.
